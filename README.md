## Technology

Optimo is a multi-objective optimization tool and it is part of for BIM-based Performance Optimization (BPOpt) that is created to be used on [Dynamo](http://dynamobim.org/learn/). Optimo is developed based on [jmetal.NET](http://jmetalnet.sourceforge.net/) open source code, which was originaly created by Antonio J. Nebro

## Optimization Algorithms ##
Optimization Algorithms as a part of AI are gaining more attention as design tools, in addition to as solution-finding tools. This forkâ€˜s intention is to populize different types of Black-Box Optimization algorithms (metaheuristics, direct search and model-based) and digitalizing of the [Entscheidungsproblem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem) (decision problem).
The project started during the first [AEChackathon-germany](http://aechackathon-germany.de/projects/) in Munich. The [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15APGdjmCGrq_VQCdsNMDKrreIzHvAMOuOwoQDg4KKvo/edit#slide=id.g214d492951_0_179) explains briefly the key points of the problem-solution process.
The code will be uploaded shortly...
